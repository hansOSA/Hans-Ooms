           Not too long ago there was a lot of buzz about Gamestop, AMC, and other stocks being pumped up to drive out
           the corporate short sellers on Wall Street and make them lose money. 

           Again still recently there's a lot of buzz about crypto, NFT's, web3 and a bunch of other markets that are
           currently overinflated (not saying there's no long term value in these, but that the current market patterns match 
           that of a bubble).

           These brought me back to an old question I used to ponder. The people who try to directly benefit from this by posting
           on social media and driving prices up, why do they do it? Surely not many people actually follow these guys do they? We as
           a society have learned from the many bubbles in history, the Wolf of Wall Street, and Boiler Room to no longer fall for 
           pump and dump schemes right?
               
           Yeah lol good joke. I've always wanted to know if there were any financial motiviation for trying to do it still. Back in
           the day there were whole trading strategies developed off of signing up to as many stock newsletters as you can and monitoring
           their alerts, being among the first to buy when an alert comes out, and selling a few minutes into the oncoming wave of bids.
           Does this still happen anymore? I was curious. 

           Nowadays the email newsletter I would consider pretty dead (at least among the dumber money of youth). Now I'd say the most 
           news-ish app we use is twitter and tiktok. I don't feel like sprawling through tiktoks algorithm, but twitter is a different story.
